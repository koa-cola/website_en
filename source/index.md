[koa-cola](https://koa-cola.github.io/) is SSR(server side render)/SPA(singe page application) framework with koa/react/react-router/redux/typescript, and using reactjs stack(react component/react-router/react-redux) and "isomorphic" codes (used in both browser and server side).

Actually this framework is my experimental work to explore the advanced area of javascript and node.js, like "isomorphic" in reactjs stack(react component/react-router/react-redux), async/await, typescript, es7 decorator, etc.

### Features
* completely and seamless SSR/SPA solution.
* support "isomorphic" which can write reusable codes running in both browser and server.
* require latest koa as web server base.
* es7 decorator style coding
* use typescript
